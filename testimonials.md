Farewell, My Love (StandBy Records)

> &#8220;Philip Jewell has always provided high quality services for affordable prices. He&#8217;s always willing to work with each individual on making their visions come to live & creating something that is one of a kind.&#8221; &#8211; Chad Kowal

Multimedia Journalist, M.S. Candidate at Columbia Journalism School

> &#8220;Philip is an impeccable web designer and developer. I started working with Philip after one of my friends (and a former client of his) recommended him to me. At the time, I was talking with a few web developers about potentially working together, but now I am so glad I decided to reach out to Philip and collaborate with him. Philip took a PSD file of what I wanted my personal writer website/blog to look like and brought it to life. He is incredibly caring and attentive to his clients&#8217; goals and needs, and puts his whole heart into a project. He helped me boost my Google rankings, installed all the WordPress plugins I would ever need and perfected my website down to the smallest, most minute detail. I cannot recommend Philip highly enough.&#8221; &#8211; Wendy Lu

> &#8220;Hi there! I&#8217;m a bike messenger by day, aspiring actor by night, and this is my website. I live in Los Angeles, have a great dog named Jack, and I like piÃ±a coladas. (And gettin&#8217; caught in the rain.)&#8221; &#8211; Richard Brown

> &#8220;Commissioned Philip to help me develop my personal website. I sent him a giant PSD and he turned it into a fully-functioning website. He built it from scratch, used no templates, and helped me optimize it to the #1 search result on Google. Worked with him twice and would do so again in a heartbeat.&#8221; &#8211; Lauren Winn
