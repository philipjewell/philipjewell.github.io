For those that know me, I always try to push my limits and try new things in regards to design. This time around, I offered to do a lyric video which is something I have wanted to do for a long time. One of my great friends: Dara McLean Korn and her latest band <a href="http://www.virsces.com/" target="_blank">Virsces</a>Â just released their first single which is the single I decided to do the video on.
