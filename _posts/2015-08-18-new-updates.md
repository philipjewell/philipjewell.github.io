Welcome to philipjewell.com era:2016. Not much has changed visually, but the site is built with a new framework. My work as of lately has shifted away from design and more towards development. As I tackle work related projects, you will also see creation of new WordPress plugins developed by me which can be found <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/philipjewell#content-plugins" target="_blank">here</a>.

Projects will consist mostly of collaborations and this site will be use more for portfolio purposes, straying away from providing services.

You can expect new findings as troubleshooting methodology, helpful tools and services to be found in the new blog posts for my site in order to assist those around the web. Majority will be WordPress and Ubuntu related.

I hope you enjoy the new content!
